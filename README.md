# Many-Time-Pad-Attack

In Many Time Pad, one key is used to encrypt multiple messages which makes it vulnerable and easy for hackers to crack it.
So, developed a python program to decrypt a ciphertext that was encrypted using many time pad. 
This is to demonstrate that messages encrypted with one key can be vulnerable to attacks and not a recommended approach.
